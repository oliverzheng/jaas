                Keeping up with the JavaScript ecosystem is hard &ndash; there are countless
                frameworks and new ones are released daily. It is not sustainable to
                always learn about the latest and greatest and be productive.
              </p>
              <p>
                J&#x101;as is the service you need to both use the latest JavaScript
                technology and have time to hit your deadlines.

            <p>
              J&#x101;as abstracts away the abstractions created by JavaScript libraries,
              frameworks, toolchains, compilers, and linters so you can enjoy the
              benefits of being on the bleeding edge without having to learn about them.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can write JavaScript like it's 1998, and J&#x101;as will turn it into
              modern type-safe, modular, and maintainable JavaScript that uses the
              hottest new libraries to accomplish the same thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now you can choose exactly how hip you are.

            <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
            <p>
              Not everyone is ready for the future so swiftly. Here is why you
              shouldn't be a hater.
            </p>
            <h3>How does J&#x101;as actually work? Is this vaporware?</h3>
            <p>
              When you write any old school JavaScript, just run it as you normally
              would, either in your browser or on a potato. J&#x101;as will detect the
              underlying operations done at the DOM or operating system level and
              reconstruct sensible components using new frameworks to do exactly the
              same thing, but with more lines of code and more dependencies.
            </p>
            <h3>How can I debug modern JavaScript if I don't know how it works?</h3>
            <p>The same as you would if you didn't use J&#x101;as.</p>
            <h3>
              Bloat is a concern. Does J&#x101;as make the page load slower or use
              more resources?
